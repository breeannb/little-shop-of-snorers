# Assignment Overview: Lab 11

## Terrible Novelty Gift Shop Survey App!

### Little Shop of "Snore"ers

You are an app developer. You are NOT making an e-commerce site. Your client is starting a terrible novelty gift shop in the mall. They can only afford to order so many terrible novelty gifts for their shop. They need to know which items are most likely to sell.

You will develop an app to survey users and answer one important question: what crappy things are YOU most likely to buy?

## Requirements/Guidance

**This is an individual assignment. You will do planning together in groups, but you will code and submit your own app. Use the group wireframes as a guide, but feel free to carve your own path if you like.**

1. You'll need data that describes the products. Include: 
    * an `id` that uniquely identifies each product
    * an `image` property that is the path to image to display
    * a `name` property that is the product name to display
1. The thing you want to build today will select three random photos from the 
available product images and display them side-by-side-by-side in the browser window.
1. In addition, you'll want to be able to receive clicks on those displayed images, and track those clicks for each image. You'll also want to track how many times each image is displayed, for statistical purposes. Do this for:
    * A single, individual user session
    * STRETCH: Add the session to an array of all sessions stored in local storage. This can be used to report on all-time results
1. Keep in mind that the Individual user session should "restart" on each page load
1. Upon receiving a click, three new non-duplicating random images need to be automatically displayed. In other words, the three images that are displayed should contain no duplicates, [AS A STRETCH: nor should they duplicate with any images that we displayed immediately before (you may want to layer in this second requirement after the first is working)].
1. After 25 selections have been made, navigate the user to the reults page and display a list of the products with *times viewed* and *votes received*. You do not need to display products that were not viewed.
1. Create a separate page that:
    1. Retrieves the all-time results (all sessions) from localStorage
    2. Iterates through the session results and creates grand totals
    3. Displays list of all-time results.

## Planning

**Note: There's a lot of moving pieces in this assignment, and more details to attend to than it might seem at first. Build methodically, in small pieces, that you test and check regularly. ACP regularly on at least one non-master branch. Try sketching out a plan on paper and breaking down the problem conceptually before getting into the code.**

Spend 30-45 minutes _IN GROUPS_ planning out your projects today.

Start by reading this document in its entirety. Especially the "requirements/guidance" section.

### Group Wireframe

Also draft a plan for the project (a detailed to-do list of things to make, step by step and tested at each stage) before getting into the code. That time spent in thought and planning will make the code flow a lot faster. Give yourself a series of little problems to solve (rather an a ginormous thing that you just wade through and poke at).

1. WHAT IS YOUR STATE? How will you represent it as a view?
1. What pages will need to be created?
1. What data will need to be saved, updated, and when?
1. What variables will need to be used to track data?
1. What data will need to be saved to local storage?

## Setup For This Lab

Do today's work on a branch! (not `master`)

* Create a new repo for this weekly project called `little-shop-of-snorers`
* Clone locally and setup with usually config/scaffolding
* Copy into the repo:
    * This `README.md` lab instructions, and
    * The `assets/` directory of images
* Inclde your wireframe in the repo

## More Stretch Goals For This Lab...

* Handle the display and voting for an arbitrary number of images
* Using a variable, declare in your JS how many images to show
* Based on that value, dynamically create that many `<img>` tags
* Also based on that value, ensure that your randomizer is properly handling the specified number of images for display and repeat tracking.

## Points Break Down

Looking For | Points (10)
:--|--:
Wireframe and group technial plan added to repo | 2
Display three random images that are different | 3
Track TIMES VIEWED and TIMES VOTED for items during a single session | 3
Display SINGLE-SESSION results on completion on a results page | 2
Track and display all-time views and clicks (over multiple sessions) in addition to single session | +4
Display random images _with weird non-duplication rules (i.e., don't show the same image in two different consecutive questions)_ | +2
